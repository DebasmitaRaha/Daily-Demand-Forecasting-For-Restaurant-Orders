# Daily-Demand-Forecasting-For-Restaurant-Orders
This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict daily demand for restaurant orders based on historical data. By accurately forecasting future orders, businesses can optimize inventory, reduce waste, and better meet customer needs.
The project demonstrates the application of simple machine learning techniques like linear regression and time series analysis to improve operational efficiency.

# Features
* Data preprocessing with one-hot encoding and feature scaling.
* Splitting data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
* Implementation of Linear Regression for demand prediction.
* Visualization of trends and model performance.

# Technologies Used
* Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Machine Learning model: LinearRegression
* Model Evaluation: Mean_squared_error

# Project Workflow
1. Data Import and Preprocessing
   * Importing necessary libraries.
   * Encoding categorical variables with one-hot encoding.
2. Data Splitting
   * Splitting data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
3. Model Building
   * Training the Linear Regression model on preprocessed data.
   * Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error.
4. Prediction
   * Generating predictions for the test data.
5. Visualization
   * Visualizing trends and model accuracy through various plots.
